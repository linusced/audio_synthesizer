# audio_synthesizer
A simple program for audio synthesis. You can create waveforms by using up to 51 harmonics and you can modify the ADSR envelope for your sound. You can play your sound using the computer keyboard or an external MIDI device.
It uses OpenGL for graphics, OpenAL for audio, FFTW for frequency analysis, RtMidi for MIDI support and TinyExpr for simple math operations for the waveform harmonics ampltude and phase.

In the future I might add a way to download the .app file/directory (for mac only).
